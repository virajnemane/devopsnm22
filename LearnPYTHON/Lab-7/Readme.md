## Loops in python

### WHILE loop
In this lab we will see **while** loop in python. 

Sometimes we need to perform particular task endlessly if any condition become true, **while** loop will help in this.

Let's check out syntax for **while** loop

    while [CONDITION:
        // body of while loop

Let's see example to understand it.

    while (2>1):
        print("This is while loop !!")

In above example we are trying to test a condition. Here ....
- If test output is true then only while loop will get executed. 
- Once while loop get executed, it won't stop.

We already learn **continue** and **break** keyword which will help us to control while loop.

Now lets test yourself.

Write a python script, which will 
- Take any alpha character from user
- Print alpha character on the screen
- If char is "c" or "C", then loop should continue, but "c" or "C" should not print on the screen.
- If char is "q" or "Q" then while loop should get exited.
