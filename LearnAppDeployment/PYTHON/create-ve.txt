In python application deployment, each application create it's own virtual environment,
to isolate its package bundle from actual python package installed on system.

It gives flexibility to developer to install and use any package of any version for his application development.

Also it helps to keep python installation done with OS as it is. 

In process of virtual environment creation, it just create copy of python installer at given path.
